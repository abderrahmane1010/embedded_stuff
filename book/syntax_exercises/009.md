In a group G, we dene the three following problems:
CDH (Computational Die-Hellman):
Given: g ∈ G a generator, A = ga ∈ G and B = gb ∈ G (but a and b are not known)
Compute: gab = Ba = Ab.

DLOG (Discrete Logarithm):
Given: g ∈ G a generator and y ∈ G
Compute: x ∈ {1 . . . |G|}, such that y = gx.

EG-DEC (ElGamal-Decrypt):
Given: g ∈ G a generator, pk = gx, H = gr and D = (gx)r m (but x, r, m are unknown)
Compute: m ∈ G
